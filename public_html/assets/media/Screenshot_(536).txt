Shweta Mathur thanks, | think this plugin only works well for bringing in fresh
students in bulk to coursefunnels.

Then, how about existing students who are already taking one or two courses that
they got access to upon registration. If | attach a new course to the course
registration page, these existing students don't see those courses, only new
students registering can see the new course in addition to the previous courses.
So how do we make it possible for any new course added to the membership to
be available for these existing students?

Or, If I use the plugin to import these students, what happens to their current
login details? Will it still be working good for them? Or every existing student
must start using the new Limo$1234 format?

Is it possible to program the system so that during the import student in bulk
process Coursefunnels can check if students exist first, if student exist the system
can allow their existing membership password to stand, and only make new
password rule for fresh students?

We don't want to disrupt existing students access password in the process of
importing them to membership
